strings.push("A writ of mandamus will not issue unless three elements co-exist (1) a clear legal right in the petitioner to the relief sought;  (2) a legal duty on the part of respondent to do the thing which the petitioner seeks to compel;  and (3) the absence of another adequate remedy.” Syllabus Point 1, State ex rel. Billy Ray C. v. Skaff, 190 W.Va. 504, 438 S.E.2d 847 (1993); Syllabus Point 2, State ex rel. Kucera v. City of Wheeling, 153 W.Va. 538, 170 S.E.2d 367(1969).” Syllabus point 2, Staten v. Dean, 195 W.Va. 57, 464 S.E.2d 576 (1995). Syl. pt. 2, Ewing v. Board of Educ. of Summers County, 202 W. Va. 228, 503 S.E.2d 541 (1998). Thus, we must ascertain whether the petitioner has satisfactorily fulfilled these criteria and demonstrated his entitlement to mandamus relief.");
strings.push("We note that Collins cites only two cases in which courts have set aside a fine for violating the Eighth Amendment, both featuring extremely large penalties contrasted with minimal harm. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 339 (1998) (holding invalid forfeiture of $357,000 for failing to report exported currency, “affect[ing] only . . . the Government, and in a relatively minor way”); United States ex rel. Bunk v. Birkart Globistics GmbH & Co., 2012 WL 488256, at *5 (E.D. Va. Feb. 14, 2012) (invalidating penalty of $50 million for False Claims Act violations when no showing of resulting economic harm). The Commission’s penalty here does not belong in that small club.");
strings.push("The false dichotomy between “jurisdictional” and “non-jurisdictional” agency interpretations may be no more than a bogeyman, but it is dangerous all the same. Like the Hound of the Baskervilles, it is conjured by those with greater quarry in sight: Make no mistake—the ultimate target here is Chevron itself. Savvy challengers of agency action would play the “jurisdictional” card in every case. See, e.g., Cellco Partnership v. FCC, 700 F. 3d 534, 541 (CADC 2012). Some judges would be deceived bythe specious, but scary-sounding, “jurisdictional”-“nonjurisdictional” line; others tempted by the prospect of making public policy by prescribing the meaning of am-biguous statutory commands. The effect would be to transfer any number of interpretive decisions—archetypal Chevron questions, about how best to construe an ambigu-ous term in light of competing policy interests—from the agencies that administer the statutes to federal courts.");
strings.push("The dissent is correct that United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218 (2001), requires that, for Chevron deference to apply, the agency must have received congressional authority to determine the particular matter at issue in the particular manner adopted. No one disputes that. But Mead denied Chevron deference to action, by an agency with rulemaking authority, that was not rulemaking. What the dissent needs, and fails to produce, is a single case in which a general conferral of rulemaking or adjudi-cative authority has been held insufficient to support Chevron deference for an exercise of that authority within the agency’s substantive field. There is no such case, and what the dissent proposes is a massive revision of our Chevron jurisprudence.");
